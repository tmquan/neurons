"""Connected-component relabeling for instance segmentation labels.

After random spatial cropping, a single instance can become split into
disconnected parts that share the same label value.  ``Labeld`` runs
connected-component analysis (value-based connectivity) to assign each
disconnected part a unique label, then renumbers sequentially.

GPU path uses ``cucim.skimage.measure.label``; CPU fallback uses
``skimage.measure.label``.  Both treat two pixels as connected only
when they are neighbours **and** share the same value, which is the
correct behaviour for instance segmentation maps.
