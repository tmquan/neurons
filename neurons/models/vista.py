"""Shared task-head modules.

This module holds the VISTA3D-style building blocks shared across our
3D wrappers (``Vista3DWrapper``, ``CosmosTransfer3DWrapper``,
``CosmosPredict3DWrapper``) so every wrapper applies an *actual*
VISTA3D-style task head instead of the minimal ``Conv3-Norm-ReLU-Conv1``
adapter we used to ship.

Rationale
---------
MONAI's reference VISTA3D implementation
(``monai.networks.nets.vista3d.ClassMappingClassify``) refines its backbone
features with ``image_post_mapping`` — two residual ``UnetrBasicBlock``
stacks operating at the encoder feature width:

.. code-block:: python

    image_post_mapping = nn.Sequential(
        UnetrBasicBlock(..., res_block=True, norm_name="instance"),
        UnetrBasicBlock(..., res_block=True, norm_name="instance"),
    )

That is the "head" in VISTA3D proper.  Our previous per-task adapter
(``Conv3x3 → GroupNorm → ReLU → [Dropout] → Conv1x1``) has roughly half
the depth and no residual connection, which noticeably under-fits on
dense-prediction tasks like connectomics.  ``VistaTaskHead3D`` below is
the drop-in replacement that mirrors the real VISTA3D head and simply
swaps the class-embedding mask-attention output for a plain 1×1 conv,
since our per-voxel tasks (semantic logits, instance embeddings, geometry
regressions) don't need the learned class embedding table.

class VistaTaskHead3D(nn.Module):
    """VISTA3D-style dense-prediction head.

    Mirrors ``ClassMappingClassify.image_post_mapping`` from MONAI's
    reference VISTA3D: two residual 3-D UnetrBasicBlocks refine the
    feature map at a shared width, and a final 1×1 convolution projects
    to the task-specific channel count.

    Architecture::

        (optional) Conv1x1:  in_channels -> refine_channels   # width matcher
        UnetrBasicBlock(res=True, kernel=3, norm="instance")  # refine
        UnetrBasicBlock(res=True, kernel=3, norm="instance")  # refine
        Dropout3d(dropout)
        Conv1x1:             refine_channels -> out_channels   # task head

    The width matcher is inserted only when ``in_channels != refine_channels``
    so the head can be plugged on top of either the VISTA3D encoder
    (feature_size output) or the Cosmos VAE decoder (arbitrary hidden
    width ``_hidden_ch``).

    Args:
        in_channels: Channel count of the backbone/decoder feature map
            fed into the head.
        out_channels: Task-specific output width (``num_classes`` for
            semantic, ``emb_dim`` for instance, ``geom_channels`` for
            geometry).
        refine_channels: Width at which the residual refinement blocks
            operate.  Defaults to ``in_channels`` (VISTA3D's convention).
            Passing a smaller value (e.g. ``feature_size=64``) is the
            cheap-but-faithful variant used when the decoder emits many
            channels and we don't want 2 × in_channels² cost per head.
        dropout: Channel-wise dropout applied just before the final 1×1.
            VISTA3D itself uses zero dropout; we expose it to preserve
            the behaviour of the old Cosmos adapter heads.
        norm_name: Normalisation used inside the residual blocks.
            Kept as a parameter for forward-compat; VISTA3D uses
            ``"instance"`` (the default here).
